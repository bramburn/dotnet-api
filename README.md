Basic dotnet API build on dotnet c# tutorial.

# Instructions

To build the app you need to have .net sdk 6, you can get a copy of it from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

Once installed you can run the app in the terminal window using the following command:

```shell
dotnet run
```

This will provide you with a localhost server running that you can interact with.
